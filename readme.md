# 🔄 Logic Flows  

### 🔐Auth Logic 

## 1. Register Flow
**Purpose:** Allow users to create an account.

### Steps:
1. **Start** → User initiates a registration request.
2. **Validate registration data**:
   - Uses `CustomerRegistrationSerializer` to check fields (e.g., username, password, email).
3. **Is data valid?**  
   - **No** → Return `400 Bad Request` with validation errors (e.g., duplicate email, weak password).  
   - **Yes** → Proceed to the next step.
4. **Create user** → Save the validated data to the database.
5. **Return `201 Created`** (successful registration).

### Key Features:
- Public endpoint (no authentication required).
- Relies on Django REST Framework’s `CreateAPIView` for streamlined user creation.


## 2. Login Flow
**Purpose:** Authenticate a user and generate an access token.

### Steps:
1. **Start** → User submits credentials (e.g., username/password).
2. **Validate login data**:
   - Uses `LoginSerializer` to verify credentials.
3. **Is data valid?**  
   - **No** → Return `400 Bad Request` (e.g., invalid password, missing fields).  
   - **Yes** → Proceed to the next step.
4. **Fetch user** → Extract the validated user from the serializer.
5. **Get/Create token** → Generate a unique auth token (or reuse an existing one).
6. **Return `200 OK`** with the token (used for authenticated requests).

### Key Features:
- Token-based authentication (DRF’s Token model).
- Tokens persist until manually deleted (e.g., during logout).

## 3. Logout Flow
**Purpose:** Invalidate the user’s session by deleting their token.

### Steps:
1. **Start** → User sends a logout request.
2. **Check authentication**:  
   - **No** → Return `403 Forbidden` (unauthorized access).  
   - **Yes** → Proceed to the next step.
3. **Delete token** → Remove the user’s auth token (e.g., `request.user.auth_token.delete()`).
4. **Return `200 OK`** with a success message.

![Flowchart: Auth](assets/images/auth-logic.jpeg)



### 📚Books Logic  

1. Start
2. Retrieve book object by ID (from URL/path parameter)
3. Fetch all comments for the book (e.g., book.comments.all())
4. Serialize comments (using CommentSerializer)
5. Return 200 OK with serialized data → End

![Flowchart: Books](assets/images/books-logic.jpeg)


---

### 📩Contact Logic    

1. Start
2. Check request method:
3. POST:
4. Create serializer with request.data
5. Is serializer valid?
6. No:
7. Return 400 Bad Request (with errors) → End
8. Yes:
9. Save data (to database)
10. Return 201 Created → End
11. GET Flow (List Contacts)
12. Start
13. Check request method:
14. GET:
15. Fetch all contacts from the database
16. Serialize contacts data (using ContactSerializer)
17. Return 200 OK (with serialized data) → End

## ⚡ Agile Development  

### 📌Overview 

![KanbanBoard](assets/images/user-story-listä.png)

To ensure smooth project management, I utilized **Agile methodology** along with a **Kanban board** in GitHub Projects. This approach helped in tracking progress, managing tasks, and ensuring timely completion of features.  

- **Epics & User Stories:** The project was broken down into **user stories** to prioritize development.  
- **Task Breakdown:** Each user story was divided into smaller **tasks** for better tracking and completion.  
- **Iterative Development:** Features were implemented in **sprints**, allowing continuous improvement.  

To see the project's **Kanban board**, [click here](https://github.com/users/NewcoderM/projects/3/views/1).

### 📌User Stories

![KanbanBoard12](assets/images/user-story-details.png)

To build a user-centric product, I stepped into the shoes of future users and identified essential features and functionalities. This led to the creation of **12 User Stories**:  
- **6 Mandatory** stories, providing core functionality.  

Each **User Story** included:  
- **Acceptance Criteria**  
- **Bite-sized Tasks** for easy tracking  
- **Bug Tracking & Comments** to document issues and solutions  

As tasks were completed, user stories moved from **"In Progress"** to **"Completed"** in the Kanban workflow.

---

### 📋List of User Stories  

#### ✅ **Mandatory User Stories**  
1. **USER STORY: User needs to authenticate**  
2. **USER STORY: Need to contact**  
3. **USER STORY: Need a place to see the books and book details**  
4. **USER STORY: Need a place to comment on a book**  
5. **USER STORY: Structure Database**  
6. **USER STORY: Create UX**

## 📌API 


![API](assets/images/api-home.png)

[Link](https://booksandbeyond-server-production.up.railway.app/api/)


Why I feel API-based architecture (DRF) is better than traditional Django views?  

Instead of using **traditional Django views**, we opted for a **RESTful API using DRF**. Here’s why:  

1️⃣ **Separation of Concerns**  
   - The **backend (DRF)** handles data logic, while **React** focuses on UI.  
   - Makes code **more modular and maintainable**.  

2️⃣ **Scalability**  
   - APIs can serve multiple frontends (Web, Mobile, etc.).  
   - A **React frontend can be easily replaced or updated** without touching the backend.  

3️⃣ **Performance**  
   - DRF allows for **optimized data retrieval** using serialization.  
   - Reduces **redundant database queries** compared to traditional Django templates.  

4️⃣ **Security**  
   - **JWT authentication** ensures secure login across devices.  
   - **CORS handling** protects the API from unauthorized access.

### 🐞Known Bugs and Issues  
- 🔹 **Minor UI Issue:** Some elements may slightly misalign on very small screens.  
- 🔹 **Button Styling Issue:** A green submit button is automatically generated by the form system and does not follow the custom styling.  
- 🔹 **Past Booking Prevention:** The function that prevents users from selecting past dates for a booking is not fully working. However, admins can still verify and reject such bookings manually.  

**📌 Note:** These bugs do not affect core functionality and will be addressed in future updates.

# 🚀Deployment

I deployed my fullstack Django + React project on [Railway](https://railway.app/). I chose Railway over Heroku because SQLite (which I used for my database) is not well-suited for Heroku's ephemeral filesystem.

---

## Why I Chose Railway

- *Persistent Storage*: Unlike Heroku, which resets its filesystem on every deploy, Railway provides persistent storage, making it suitable for SQLite.
- *Easy Deployments*: Railway allows seamless deployments for both backend and frontend in a single project.
- *Built-in Database Support*: While I used SQLite for simplicity, Railway also supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, and more.

---

## 1. Setting Up My Railway Project

1. Signed up at [Railway](https://railway.app/).
2. Clicked "New Project" and chose *Deploy from GitHub*.
3. Connected my GitHub repository.

---

## 2. Deploying My Backend (Django)

### 2.1 Setting Up Procfile
I created a Procfile in my Django project root:

sh
echo 'web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi' > Procfile


### 2.2 Installing Dependencies
I ensured my requirements.txt had the necessary dependencies:

txt
gunicorn
django
django-cors-headers
djangorestframework
dotenv


### 2.3 Configuring settings.py
I modified settings.py:

python
import os
import dj_database_url

DEBUG = False
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
    }
}


### 2.4 Adding Static Files Support

python
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'


Then, I ran:

sh
python manage.py collectstatic


### 2.5 Deploying the Backend
I committed the changes and pushed them to GitHub. Then, in Railway:

1. Added a new service → *GitHub Repo* → Selected backend.
2. Set PYTHON_VERSION=3.9 in *Variables*.
3. Set RAILWAY_STATIC_URL for static files (if needed).
4. Clicked *Deploy*.

---

## 3. Deploying My Frontend (React)

### 3.1 Building My React App

I ensured package.json had:

json
"scripts": {
  "build": "react-scripts build"
}


Then, I ran:

sh
npm install
npm run build


### 3.2 Serving React with Django
I moved the build/ folder to Django’s static/:

sh
mv build/ myproject/static/


Then, I updated Django urls.py:

python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView
urlpatterns += [
    path('', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html')),
]


### 3.3 Deploying the Frontend
I committed the changes and pushed them to GitHub. Then, in Railway:

1. Added a new service → *GitHub Repo* → Selected frontend.
2. Set NODE_ENV=production.
3. Clicked *Deploy*.

---

## 4. Final Steps

### 4.1 Migrating My Database
In Railway, I opened the *backend terminal* and ran:

sh
python manage.py migrate


### 4.2 Creating a Superuser

sh
python manage.py createsuperuser

## 🎉 Deployment Completed!
My Django + React app is now live on Railway! 🚀
